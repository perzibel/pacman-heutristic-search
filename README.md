This is the pacman game with a hueristic option to solve the game on auto.

# start
To initiate the game, ensure that you have Python 3.6 or a more recent version installed. Next, input the following command in the command prompt:

python pacman.py

Ensure that you are executing this command from the "pacman-heuristic-search" folder in the command prompt.
